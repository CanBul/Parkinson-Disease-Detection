For generations, assessment of speech abnormalities in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) has been limited to perceptual testing or user-controlled laboratory analysis based on very small human vocalization samples. However, using speech signals, detection of Parkinson's disease is now possible with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. In this project, our aim is to detect Parkinson's disease by processing speech signals and reach the state-of-the-art level. Furthermore, we want to investigate whether our model can achieve a generalized performance for the voice signals from different languages.
